In 2021, I made the decision to become a front-end developer.

I am currently taking the course in The Rolling Scopes School.

* In 2017 I graduated from Moscow State University of Civil Engineering (National Research University).
## Code example
```javascript
function greaterThanLessThan (a,b,c) {
    return a < b < c;
}
greaterThanLessThan (5,3,2); // => true, because false == 0, true == 1
```

**I have resumed learning English and try to use it at A2 level.**
